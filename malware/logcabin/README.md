# Spring 2021 finale chal

This will be cool probably:

* Players start in Kibana analyzing some logs
  * This will be basic and I'll provide some info to help guide them so they aren't super lost
* They find some Zeek logs or something, showing a binary being downloaded from a server
  * I also kinda want to do some PowerShell encoding fun stuff, maybe that will be here
* Player downloads some malware, analyzes it, sees that it talks to a server, server will be live
* ...
* git flag win monies

Another cool thing would be adding a Discord bot that incrementally tracks progress and uploads new data into Elasticsearch as teams progress through the challenge. This would require spinning up a seperate stack for each time, which isn't a big deal since it won't be up for very long and it can be easily automated. It also requires a seperate box to run the bot and upload data to ES.
