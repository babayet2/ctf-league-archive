  <h1>Many Time Pad</h1>
  <p>
  I really like encrypting messages with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad">One-Time-Pad</a> because it is <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/3896/simply-put-what-does-perfect-secrecy-mean">perfectly secret</a>, so much better than modern crypto techniques which are only secure against computationally bounded attackers. 
  The <a href="https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/crypto/chap1.pdf">first chapter</a> of The Joy of Cryptography taught me Kerckhoff's Principle; all of the security of a cryptosystem must be concentrated in the key rather than the algorithms, so there must be no problem with me sharing the <a href="/source">source code</a> of the web server. There probably isn't any other relevant information in that chapter though, otherwise it would be dumb for me to link it in the challenge.<br>
  You might find <a href="https://www.python.org/">python</a> useful for this.</p>
