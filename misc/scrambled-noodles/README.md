```

My assistant sent me this `.wav` as an update on a case he is working on, however I dont know what to do with it. Such a frustrating April Fools Joke, and I'm missing an update on this case. 

Can you see where it leads, and possibly solve the case? We're looking for a hotspot that the subject in this case created, I don't know much more. 

Oh, and by the way, do you know what song that is?
