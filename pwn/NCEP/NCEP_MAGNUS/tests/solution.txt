The focus this week is to ensure people are capable of doing the reversing. Nobody left behind, make sure every student is running ghidra, we'll focus on the exploitation next week. By the end of the session, each student should be able to:
1. Identify structs
2. Insert comments in ghidra
3. Rename variables and functions


To actually exploit this binary:

step 1: getting /bin/bash in memory

enter "INT1" during a context switch to enter the logging menu
generate a payload with python -c 'print("A" * 0xa00 + "/bin/bash")'
edit the last log (log ID 4), and put that payload in the description
delete the log
exit 

step 2: executing /bin/bash
enter "INT2" during a context switch to get to the process creation menu
allocate a new process
add the process to the scheduler without setting any of the fields
exit

/bin/bash is now on the scheduler, just play simul chess until you get a shell
